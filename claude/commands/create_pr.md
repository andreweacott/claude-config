1. Commit staged files (if any) with a suitable descriptive comment.  Use the JIRA ticket reference as a prefix if available (ask the user if you don't have one)
2. Push the branch to origin, creating a new tracking branch if necessary
3. Create a DRAFT PR with a description in the following format:
```
## Motivation
<A high level description of the change including the reasoning and goals>

## Proposed Changes
<A more detailed set of changes included in the PR.  Do not be too verbose, the goal is to describe the changes, not bore the reader>
```
